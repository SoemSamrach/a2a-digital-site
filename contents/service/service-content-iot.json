        "description": "Internet of Things is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network.",
