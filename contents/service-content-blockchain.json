Its fabric is a private channel which distributed ledger and smart contract platform allow for smart contract called “chaincode”. Modular architecture provides a lot of flexibility in terms of what you want to use. In Hyperledger there is no cryptocurrency which means we don’t use coin for doing transaction."
