            "description":"Projection Mapping is a video projection technology that is used to transform non-flat surfaces or objects into 2D or 3D interactive video displays. 2D Projection Mapping is best used on ceilings, walls, and floors to amplify event space. 3D Projection Mapping can be used to create interactive displays out of any 3D shape from custom scenic designs to entire buildings. Our concept is to make each projection mapping project completely unique with any combination of images, motion graphics, video or animation as they are cast onto any surface. The interactivity created with projection mapping guarantees you leave a lasting impression on your event attendees."
