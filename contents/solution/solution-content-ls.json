The beginning of the process consists of a request from a customer for a particular product via an order form. These orders are then transmitted and checked for completeness and accuracy. The availability of the requested product and the customerâ€™s credit status are verified. Finally, products are retrieved from the stock, packed, and delivered along with their shipping documents.  Throughout this entire process, the customers have to be kept informed about the status of their orders."
